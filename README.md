# MetaStone #

### What is it? ###
MetaStone is a simulator for the online collectible card game (CCG) Hearthstone&reg; by Activison Blizzard written in Java. It strives to be a useful tool for card value analyzation, deck building and performance evaluation. There is also support for custom cards, allowing users to implement their own card inventions and testing them within the simulator engine. MetaStone tries to re-implement all game mechanics and rules from the original game as accurately as possible. 

### What is it not? ###
This is no Hearthstone replacement or clone. Please do not request better graphical effects, sounds or anything which makes it feel more like Hearthstone. There won't be any mode to battle against other human players. This is a tool meant for advanced players; if you just want to play Hearthstone, please play the real game.

### How do I run it on Linux? ###
* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/demilich1/metastone/releases) and download the latest release (`metastone-X_Y_Z_jar.zip`).
* Extract the contents of the .zip file.
* Open the Terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T` on Ubuntu) and access `../MetaStone-X.Y.Z/bin`.
* Execute this command: `./MetaStone`.
    * Executing `sudo ./MetaStone` will execute the file as Root ("Super User"), this is not necessary though.
    * You might need to make the file executable (On Ubuntu: Right Click the File -> Properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing file as program).
